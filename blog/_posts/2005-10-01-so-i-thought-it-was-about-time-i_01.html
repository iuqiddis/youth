So I thought it was about time i started writing down things that caught my attention during my day. I'm not really into writing blogs (or writing in general) but i figured that these minor, but memorable, things need to go somewhere before i forget them.<br /><br />I'm putting this stuff online so you guys can look at it and hopefully find it at least remotely interesting. Most of the things I post will be things <span style="font-style: italic;">I think</span> are funny or interesting(obviously), so if you don't find it worth looking at, too bad.<br /><br />Other than that, i used blogspot instead of xanga/livejournal/myspace/ because i despise the whole look of livejournal and myspace, and xanga has too many boxes/modules that are not really needed and just clutter the whole page. Having no ads also helps. And i figured that yahoo and msn have so much of my personal information that they can probably reconstruct everything about my life that i might as well get the next titan--google the same information too.
