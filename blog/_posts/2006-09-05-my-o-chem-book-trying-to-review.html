My O-Chem Book trying to review resonance hybrids:<br /><br />It is important to understand that the two structures in Eq. 1.6 are fictitious, but nitromethane is a real molecule... An analogy to this situation is a description of Fred Flatfoot, a real detective. Lacking words to describe Fred, we picture him as a resonance hybrid of two fictional characters:<br />Fred Flatfoot = [Sherlock Holmes <----> James Bond]<br />This suggests that Fred is a dashing, violin-playing, pipe-smoking, highly intelligent British agent with an assistant named Watson, and that Fred likese his Martinis shaken, not stirred.
