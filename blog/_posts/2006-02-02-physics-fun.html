Physics Fun.<br /><br />This is from a while back, but Konner took some pictures in physics class. We were learning about projectile motion. So our professor demonstrated the princples by shooting a mini canon ball at a stuffed monkey.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_-5tzfNmxc5E/SvdXxbS4BnI/AAAAAAAAGe8/c665EOEhNvY/s800/canon9pd.jpg" /><br />The canon<br /><br /><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-5tzfNmxc5E/SvdXxaxuaLI/AAAAAAAAGfA/cvMrKbXR0RE/s800/monkey8ot.jpg" /><br />The poor monkey (well actuall not so unlucky...if i recall correctly, the monkey didnt' get shot...he just fell and died.<br /><br /><br />(and if you look hard enough, you can see the indentations of previous years' canon balls on the far wall.)<br /><br />I guess that will do for now (and based on my posting rate, the next few months too).
