So, i'll start with things that i saw/heard over the past few weeks. I forgot most of the stuff, but here are the ones i remember:<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204);"><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">My professor, Ai-Ko Liu, is lecturing about limits and their properties</span>.</span><br /></span>[Liu] bla bla bla...so any questions regarding the properties of limits?<br />[Student] *compeletely serious* Is <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span> not a constant because it is a variable?<br />[Liu] *wtf face*....<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">I'm at my chem TA (Irena)'s Open Office Hours. There are a couple other people there. I'm finishing a problem and the other kids are doing their's work. Irena is like bored to fuck (or so i thought).</span></span><br />[Iuqiddis] How was your day? (her hours are in the evening)<br />[Irena] Not bad. I haven't slept in 36 hours.<br />[Iuqiddis] *shocked/quizical look*<br />[Irena] *grins* Its okay...you're just a freshman. Give it a year or two.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);font-size:85%;" >More Calc Class stuff. Btw, this guy has a Mr. Ho like fob accent. He's no doubt a genius, but he's still a fob.<br /></span>[Liu] *writing on the board*...so thats the heuristic proof for the chain rule. *turns around and sees hella confused looks* Guys its okay if you don't understand it right now. It may take a few hours or even days to understand it. I had trouble understanding the chain rule when i did Calculus in Junior High too.<br />*class starts laughing*<br />[Liu] (Imagine a lost, confused fob asking this) What happened? Did i miss something?<br />...<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now the perks (well from my nerdy perspective anyways) of being in Berkeley: A nobel laurete came to our chem 1a class for inspiration. His speech was actually pretty good. Now go be fascinated by <a href="http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1986/index.html">Dudley R. Herschbach</a><br /><br /><br />.
