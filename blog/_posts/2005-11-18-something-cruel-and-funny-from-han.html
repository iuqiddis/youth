<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Something cruel and funny from Han.</span><br /><br /><br />A Mathematical Proof that Rakesh will not get an A in his Chem class:<br /><br />First let me establish a fundamental.<br /><br />Lemma 1: Rakesh is dumb.<br />Proof: Look at his high school transcript.<br /><br />Theorem 1.1: Rakesh cannot get an A in chem.<br /><br />Proof:<br />First, let us suppose he did get an A in chem. Then we must come to the conclusion that he<br />is of reasonable intelligence. However, this is contradictory to the assertion of Lemma 1 which states that Rakesh is dumb. Thus through proof by contradiction, we conclude that Rakesh cannot get an A in chem.
