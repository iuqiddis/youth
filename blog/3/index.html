        On T.A.'s

      Like most other science classes, my physics class has a lab and discussion section to it. Just like any other class, each discussion section has their own T.A.. However, the labs are done in conjunction with another discussion section so basically there are two classes (each with their own T.A.) doing a particular lab together.<br /><br />Today I go to lab as usual, and start the lab. As we're doing the lab we come across a totally new concept, so the other section's T.A. goes on the board and introduces the concepts to all the students (both sections).<br /><br />I figure I should pay attention so I look up. And then I just start staring at her. She was rather hot. Well she wasn't really hot. She was probably a seven to eight. But I didn't have my glasses on, so she became a definite eight. Then I had to factor in the fact that we're in berkeley, and she's a physics T.A.; obviously she becomes a 9. So i continue staring at her while she talks.<br /><br />After a while, I'm like dude shame on you, so I turn aside and look at my work. But then I realize I don't know the concepts yet, so I look up to pay attention to the instructions she's giving. And then I start staring at her again.<br /><br />After about half an hour, the class ended.<br />I payed attention to her yet didn't pay any attention to her.<br />I still don't know how to do the worksheets.<br /><br />Next time, I think my section's T.A. should present the concepts. She doesn't distract me when I look at her :P

      Physics Fun.<br /><br />This is from a while back, but Konner took some pictures in physics class. We were learning about projectile motion. So our professor demonstrated the princples by shooting a mini canon ball at a stuffed monkey.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_-5tzfNmxc5E/SvdXxbS4BnI/AAAAAAAAGe8/c665EOEhNvY/s800/canon9pd.jpg" /><br />The canon<br /><br /><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_-5tzfNmxc5E/SvdXxaxuaLI/AAAAAAAAGfA/cvMrKbXR0RE/s800/monkey8ot.jpg" /><br />The poor monkey (well actuall not so unlucky...if i recall correctly, the monkey didnt' get shot...he just fell and died.<br /><br /><br />(and if you look hard enough, you can see the indentations of previous years' canon balls on the far wall.)<br /><br />I guess that will do for now (and based on my posting rate, the next few months too).

Then we must come to the conclusion that he<br />is of reasonable intelligence. However, this is contradictory to the assertion of Lemma 1 which states that Rakesh is dumb. Thus through proof by contradiction, we conclude that Rakesh cannot get an A in chem.
