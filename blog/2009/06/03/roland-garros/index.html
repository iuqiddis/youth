  Even God wants Federer to win.<br /><br />This year, I was giddy like a school girl before the French Open was starting, and not because I was graduating. I just felt that this year maybe Federer might beat Nadal at Roland Garros. Sure, he's been erratic and at times seems aloof during matches, but by this point we all know that whatever ailments Federer has, they usually get taken care of by the time a Slam rolls around. What gave me a tinge of hope was Federer's game play in the pre-French clay Master tournaments. He was actually tweaking his game. Instead of the largely baseline game that has allowed him to beat pretty much everyone not named Nadal on clay in the past years (his Roland Garros record for the past 4 years reads 23-4, with all four losses coming to Nadal), he made more attempts to approach the net and started using the drop more profusely.<br /><br />I thought this was a big change because let's face it, when a guy has won 13 Grand Slams, he can justify being stubborn in not changing the game that has worked greatly for him. But after last year's drubbing at the French final, I guess he realized he would have to shake his game up to, at the very least, not get humiliated. Both these changes are not particularly dramatic, he already had them at his arsenal, he just chose not to use them. So I guess it was more of a mental adjustment to force the issue, rather than staying back and getting pounded ball after ball by Nadal and his glorious forehand.<br /><br />So with that little adjustment of his, I hoped he would at least mount a challenge to Nadal, if not win the cursed trophy.<br /><br />What I never expected was that by the time the second week of Roland Garros rolls around, not only Nadal, but Djokovic, and Murray would be all out of the tournament. Okay, maybe I wasn't sure about Murray, but with form both Nadal and Djokovic were in, I expected them to go far. This is monumental for Federer. This year, his record reads 30-6. You remove the losses against these three, and it reads 30-1. The biggest threats to Federer simply dropped dead (almost literally in Djokovic's case the way he lost his match). The way his luck is going, Monfils will probably break a leg mid-match, Del Potro will, well...he always bends over anyways...and whoever the other finalist will be...well maybe he can witness some vintage Federer tennis.<br /><br />That being said, I think the biggest threat to Federer career slam would be Monfils. He's very athletic and chases down practically anything that comes his way, so if Federer isn't playing his best, it might be trouble. If Federer plays like he did in the later sets against Haas or Mathieu from the get go, the match will be over in three sets. When he's on, no man not named Nadal can beat him on clay.<br /><br />We'll find out what happens in less than six hours from now.
